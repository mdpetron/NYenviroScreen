[`Model Development.R`](https://github.com/mdpetron/NYenviroScreen/blob/master/Model%20Development.R) contains the code to develop the NYenviroScreen Models and Decision Tree. 

[`GINI Figure.R`](https://github.com/mdpetron/NYenviroScreen/blob/master/GINI%20Figure.R) contains code to reproduce the NYenviroScreen GINI figure as well as explore other GINI figures.

[`Spider Plots.R`](https://github.com/mdpetron/NYenviroScreen/blob/master/Spider%20Plots.R) contains code to reproduce the Spider Plots displaying each component of the NYenviroScreen score.

[`State Maps.R`](https://github.com/mdpetron/NYenviroScreen/blob/master/State%20Maps.R) contains code to reproduce maps displaying the NYenviroScreen score across the state of New York.

[`NYenviroScreen-app`](https://github.com/mdpetron/NYenviroScreen/tree/master/NYenviroScreen-app) contains the code used to develop the interactive data viewer.
